# Todo App


1. Ignore the Main.js and Note.js in Components, they were an attempt to make the app without using Redux
2. When run, it will show an error that i'm unable to solve yet
3. I followed a Youtube tutorial and typed what they typed (with small changes with the names), it seems to be working for them but not for me

=> So i just wanna check if i'm on the right track? Am i using Redux correctly? What is missing in what I'm doing?

I checked so many examples which are more complicated and doing things differently (especially with dispatching) so i'm pretty confused and not confident with how the implementation should be.
